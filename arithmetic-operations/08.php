Foo Corporation needs a program to calculate how much to pay their hourly employees. The US Department of
 Labor requires that employees get paid time and a half for any hours over 40 that they work in a single week.
 For example, if an employee works 45 hours, they get 5 hours of overtime, at 1.5 times their base pay. The State of
 Massachusetts requires that hourly employees be paid at least $8.00 an hour. Foo Corp requires that an employee not work more than 60 hours in a week.

Summary
An employee gets paid (hours worked) × (base pay), for each hour up to 40 hours.
For every hour over 40, they get overtime = (base pay) × 1.5.
The base pay must not be less than the minimum wage ($8.00 an hour). If it is, print an error.
If the number of hours is greater than 60, print an error message.
Write a method that takes the base pay and hours worked as parameters, and prints the total pay or an error. Write a main method that
 calls this method for each of these employees:

Employee	Base Pay	Hours Worked
Employee 1	$7.50	35
Employee 2	$8.20	47
Employee 3	$10.00	73
*/

function FooCorp($rate, $hrs): bool
{

     if ($rate < 8.00 || $hrs > 60){
         echo "Error!";
     } elseif($hrs <= 40){
         echo ($hrs * $rate);
     } else {
         echo (40 * $rate + ($hrs - 40) * 1.5 * $rate);
     }
     return false;
}

echo FooCorp(7.50, 35);
echo "\n";
echo FooCorp(8.20, 47);
echo "\n";
echo FooCorp(10.00, 73);
echo "\n";
